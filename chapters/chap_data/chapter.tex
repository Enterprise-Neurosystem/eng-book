Data Scientists - Skills may not be available-  

Can have alternate solutions here -
Nocode  may help build or Lowcode -  with minimum code
Crowd sourcing  - can be a good breeding platform that can also be Asset / Code reuse

Medical Repo - refer to webinar.- Doctor in rural area - Volunteers in that area - Project ecoh
Gives access to a larger set of expertise. or even distant experts. Having acces to these experts

- Countries around the globe- Doctors come in from various cpuntries get together.
