\subsection{Obfuscation}
The rise of very large models with trillions ($10^{12}$) of parameters is sure to tax the energy production capacity in humanity.  
One of the least efficient parts of the AI ecosystem is the transfer of bits across networks for the sake of local aggregation for training. 
A key opportunity to alleviate such inefficiency lies in Federated Learning paradigms, but a security aspect for federated learning will expose critical systems to security risk. 
For this reason, data obfuscation for exchange on public network infrastructure would significantly reduce the exposure to security risk. 

\subsection{Provenance} 
Built on the authentication for key distribution of obfuscation schemes, the provenance of data
